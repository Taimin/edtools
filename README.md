# scedtools
Collection of tools for automated processing and clustering of single-crystal electron diffraction data

### autoindex.py

Looks for files matching `XDS.INP` in all subdirectories and runs them using `XDS`.

### extract_xds_info.py

Looks files matching `CORRECT.LP` in all subdirectories and extracts unit cell/integration info. Summarizes the unit cells in the excel file `cells.xlsx`, and writes input file `CELLPARM.INP` for the program `CELLPARM`. Gathers the corresponding `XDS_ASCII.HKL` files in the local directory, and lists them in `filelist.txt`. The latter can be used as input for further processing (`fitit_permute.py`).

### make_xscale.py

Prepares an input file `XSCALE.INP` for `XSCALE` and corresponding `XDSCONV.INP` for `XDSCONV`. Finds all files matching `*_XDS_ASCII.HKL` in the current directory, or those given as command line arguments. Prompts the user to pick a unit cell, and it will only include the files with matching unit cells. The criterion used is the euclidean distance from the chosen unit cell, with a default threshold of 2.0. Also updates `CELLPARM.INP` with the selected unit cells.

### cluster.py

Parses the `XSCALE.LP` file for the correlation coefficients between reflection files to perform hierarchical cluster analysis (Giordano et al., Acta Cryst. (2012). D68, 649â€“658). The cutoff threshold can be selected by clicking in the dendrogram window. The program will write new `XSCALE.LP` files to subdirectories `cluster_N`, and run `XSCALE` on them.

### find_cell.py

This program parses `CELLPARM.INP` and shows histogram plots with the unit cell parameters. This program mimicks `CELLPARM` (http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/html_doc/cellparm_program.html) and calculates the weighted mean lattice parameters, where the weight is typically the number of observed reflections (defaults to 1.0). For each lattice parameter, the mean is calculated in a given range (default range = median+-2). The range can be changed by dragging the cursor on the histogram plots.

### make_shelx.py

Creates a shelx input file. Requires `sginfo` to be available on the system path to generate the SYMM/LATT cards.

Usage:

```
python make_shelx.py -c 10.0 20.0 30.0 90.0 90.0 90.0 -s Cmmm -m Si180 O360
```


## Requirements

- Python3.6 including `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` libraries
- Windows 10 with access to [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
- XDS and related tools must be available under WSL
- `sginfo` must be available on the system path
